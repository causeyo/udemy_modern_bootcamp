"""
Your goal in this assignment will be to add tests to the classes you created in the last section: Card  and Deck .
Try to test that instances have the right structure, and write some tests for the methods.
Use some before hooks, and try to test for expected errors as well!

Note that the shuffle  method will be difficult to test, since it produces a random output.
Rather than trying to test randomness, you may just want to write some smaller, more straightforward tests.
For instance, you could test that shuffle  doesn't change the size of the deck,
or that the list of cards before the shuffle is in a different order than after the shuffle.
